# Internship Project: React + TypeScript + Supabase 

This project was developed as part of my internship experience.  
It uses modern frontend tools to build a fully functional web application with real-time database support.

## Tech Stack
- ⚛ React JS
-  TypeScript
-  Supabase (Auth + Database)
-  CSS Modules / Tailwind (if used)
-  Vite or CRA (depending on what you used)

##  What I Learned
- Setting up and managing Supabase backend
- Building scalable React components
- Using TypeScript for type safety and clean code
- Handling authentication and protected routes
- Working in a real dev environment (version control, deployment prep, etc.)

##  How to Run Locally

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JessicaChris/react-typescript-supabase.git
cd react-typescript-supabase
npm install
npm start
